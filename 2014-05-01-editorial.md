Hey everyone,

This issue is all about animations. It's the 12th issue, meaning that we celebrate our first-year anniversary! It's been quite a ride so far, and we couldn't be happier with the responses. Okay, some of you didn't appreciate our April Fool's joke, but that was to be expected.

This issue is once again chock-full of useful articles.  We tried to cover all angles of animations, from UIView animations, to Core Animation, all the way down to creating your own animations from scratch. We talk about animation view controllers, collection views and making everything interactive.

Again, for this issue we're very thankful for all the guest writers who contributed their posts.
First of all, [Robert Böhnke]() explains us how animations work, and what to look out for when animating things.
Next, [Joachim Bondo]() explains how we can animate custom view controller transitions.
[David Rönnqvist]() shows us how UIView animations work, and how you might implement them yourself.
[Engin Kurutepe]() shares with us how to go about creating custom collection view animations.
[Nick Lockwood]() shows how to animate custom layer properties, and even how to animate non-visual things.
Finally, Florian and Chris write about interactive animations, and show how to implement them in a couple of different ways.

Cheers from Berlin,
Florian, Daniel and Chris
