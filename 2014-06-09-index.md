The very first issue of objc.io appeared one year ago, so we're celebrating our first anniversary! Thank you for all your support during this time, and especially for all the excellent contributions we have received from the community.

While all the announcements at WWDC were going on, we prepared a more timeless topic for you this month: application architecture. It picks up the theme of our very first issue, lighter view controllers, but this time around we chose a broader scope, so that the articles in this issue cover a variety of different issues you might encounter when thinking about app architecture.
