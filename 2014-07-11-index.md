This month's issue is all about the Mac, with articles focused around topics that are unique to the OS X platform, like scripting, plugins, and XPC. We also have a guide with tips for iOS developers on how to get started with AppKit.

Additionally, with the introduction of the new language Swift, we've decided to write a book about it: "Functional Programming in Swift." This will not be your standard introduction to the language, but it will focus on how to leverage Swift's language features to write functional code. It's targeted for release in September, but a pre-order option with beta access is available today.
