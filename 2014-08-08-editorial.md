Hi all,

This month's issue is about a topic we wanted to do for a long time: Testing.

Automated testing has always been a disputed topic. Some people love it, some hate it. Testing has many different aspects, and we hope that no matter what camp you're in, this issue has something that helps you improve the quality of your projects.

We will take look at umbrella term "testing" from many different perspectives to give you a broad overview of all the different techniques involved. We start out with a look at what [behavior-driven development](TODO) is about and how to use it. Then a look at learnings from using Apple's [XCTest toolchain](TODO). We dive into [dependency injection](TODO) and how it relates to testing. If you've ever wondered about [bad testing practices](TODO) was have you covered, too. [Mocking](TODO) is another common tool in the toolchest when writing tests. We finish off we two articles about testing related to user-interface code: [user interface testing](TODO), and [snapshot testing](TODO). Thanks to all the authors for contributing their experience in this field!


Happy testing,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
