Hi all,

This month's issue is about a topic we wanted to do for a long time: Testing.

Automated testing doesn't have a very longstanding tradition in Apple's developer community. Some people love it, some hate it, and others just haven gotten around to really look into it. Testing has many different aspects, and we hope that no matter what camp you're in, you'll be able to take something away form this issue.

We will take look at umbrella term "testing" from many different perspectives to give you a broad overview of all the different techniques involved: [behavior-driven development](TODO), making testing easier with [dependency injection](TODO), [testing bad practices](TODO), [mocking](TODO), Apple's [XCTest toolchain](TODO), [user interface testing](TODO), and [snapshot testing](TODO). Thanks to all the authors for contributing their experience in this field!


Happy testing,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
