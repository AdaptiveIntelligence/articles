Happy new year and welcome to objc.io issue 20!

To mark the first issue of the year, we did things a bit differently, just like last year. We ran interviews with a few developers. We hope you will enjoy this issue.

We want to thank [Andy Matuschak](/issue-20/andy-matuschak.html), [Loren Brichter](/issue-20/loren-brichter.html), and [Natasha Murashev](/issue-20/natasha-murashev.html) for being a part of this special issue.

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, and Florian.
