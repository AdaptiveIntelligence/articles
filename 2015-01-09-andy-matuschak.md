S1 00:05	Andy?
S2 00:06	Hello.
S1 00:07	Good morning.
S2 00:09	How's it going?
S1 00:10	Good, how are you?
S2 00:12	Doing well, let me put some headphones on, I'm hearing a little bit of feedback. I'll be right back.
S1 00:17	Cool.
	[silence]
S1 00:24	[inaudible].
S2 00:32	Okay, presently untangling a ridiculous knot.
S1 00:39	So, you're currently--
S3 00:42	Hi.
S1 00:43	Florian is here.
S2 00:44	Hi Florian.
S3 00:45	Nice to meet you.
S1 00:47	We didn't put you on-- so we put you on the Macbook speakers, we can also put in headphones. This is a bit easier with the talking with the two of us.
S2 00:56	It should be okay so long as one of us has them.
S1 00:58	Okay, cool. I also have like tangled headphones.
S2 01:03	This is ongoing.
S1 01:05	Yes, it's an unsolved problem. Did you recover completely?
S2 01:10	Yeah, I did. I've been having a-- as soon as I put this in, it's going to go over here-- I've been having a really rough--
	[silence]
S2 01:27	Can you hear me?
S1 01:27	You're back.
S2 01:29	Can you hear me?
	[silence]
S1 02:07	Hey.
S2 02:07	Hey, sorry, this [inaudible] crashed because of the software.
S1 02:10	Huh. I'm not sure--
S2 02:12	I still can't hear you. Okay, maybe I need to tell my Mac to send sound to these headphones. Yes, there we go. And can you hear me?
S1 02:26	Yes, we can hear you.
S3 02:28	Super.
S2 02:29	All right. Great. We're set.
S1 02:30	Awesome. This is the plan - we're recording the talk - just the audio for the conversation. And then we'll transcribe that and put it into actual words. And then edit it and then we'll send it over to you so you can have a look at it and make any comments you want.
S2 02:57	Sounds great.
S1 02:58	Yeah, cool. So we've got a lot of questions, we'll see. For us this is also a new thing.
S2 03:07	Sure, sure.
S1 03:09	I don't know, do you want to start from something easy or something hard?
S2 03:16	Let's start with something easy. I woke up about 40 minutes ago.
S1 03:19	Oh, okay. How did you get into programming? What happened that got you into this?
S2 03:30	I think like many people it was through games. I actually wasn't allowed to have games consoles for a certain period of my youth, and in that period I went to the public library a lot, and when I was nine I found these books that were meant I think to teach programming, but in fact they just had huge listings of basic source code. And they were entire books that were source listings, and they were source listings for games and so when I would play games I would type in this book of source and often there would be a syntax error like halfway through and I wouldn't understand the error messages, and wouldn't know how to fix it, so I'd have to start over and then I could play the game and after a little bit of doing that I realised that I could change the games and very rapidly things degraded from there. I learned C++, I guess I was ten because that was what people made games with and tried to write [a MUD], that was my first big project. It went okay [laughter]. The [dumb?] working stuff was beyond me.
S1 04:53	Did you finish it?
S2 04:55	I got it all going happily as a single player situation, but of course that does not accomplish the multi-user part of [MUD?] so I suppose in a way, no. I got distracted by graphics - about a year or two, ended that project - and started getting obsessed with GL and 3D rendering and all that.
S1 05:19	And then you kept on making games? Or just doing graphics?
S2 05:28	Pardon me, I'm just going to close this blind. There's a ton of sun on me right now.
S1 05:36	Tell him that we don't have [inaudible].
S2 05:38	[chuckles] Is that so?
S1 05:40	This is the view from our window.
S2 05:44	Oh, what time is it there? Is this horrible for you guys?
S1 05:49	No, it's six in the evening.
S2 05:50	Oh okay, cool.
S1 05:51	[Berlin?] is a dark city.
S2 05:54	Okay [chuckles]. I was doing games and [?] stuff for a while, sort of going through all your normal [?], all the spinning cubes and particle engines and all that stuff, and I started making actual games. And then, it was really a case of 13 year old [?]. I realise that I didn't have a graphics tool that was good for making content of the games [laughter]. So, my room-mates and I started making a pixel editor. It was called Pixen and that was my introduction to [Coco?]. That was open source, and when we had our [1O?], I think I was 14, and we went to the-- it must have been Panther or maybe Jaguar, a launch party at the Apple store in the mall. They had those at the time. We tried to give away CDs of our [laughter] pixel editor.
S1 07:02	Did it work?
S2 07:03	The Apple store people were not having any of that, no [laughter].
S1 07:08	They should have sold them instead of giving [crosstalk].
S2 07:11	[laughter] Well, it's interesting that the open source Project got adopted by another young developer who was sort of learning through open source as we did, named Matt Routekine. He kept it open source for a few years and then decided to start selling it on the Mac app store, like cell binaries, and then the store was flooded with people who had just downloaded and complied the source code and we're charging 50 cents less [laughter].
S1 07:41	Oh, interesting.
S2 07:45	And so now all future development is closed source which is a little sad, but I guess it’s a 14 year old graphics editor and so it’s okay [chuckles].
S1 07:57	Wow, nice. And is there an alternative reality where you would not have become a programmer? Did you have anything else that you found super interesting?
S2 08:10	Yeah, that's a good question. That will take a moment of reflection, one sec [chuckles].
S1 08:20	Yeah, it's obviously-- once you get dragged into it, it's kind of hard.
S2 08:26	Yeah. It was going to be engineering of some kind. I was fascinated by electrical engineering and even chemical engineering in little high school experiments, so it was going to be one of those things, and software engineering was what I could tinker with. At the time, I guess, I called it programming and not software engineering, and then some people told me, "No, no, you're supposed to call it computer science!" and, of course, at the time, I didn't understand the interesting cultural distinction that is ongoing between computer science, software engineering, and programming, which I do actually think are useful distinct terms. But we sort of misuse them interchangeably.
S1 09:13	Right. So now you're a software engineer, [mostly?].
S2 09:20	Sort of [laughter].
S1 09:22	[crosstalk] or a computer scientist.
S2 09:23	Yeah. I'm definitely not a computer scientist, although that's where my training is. I would say that I am sort of a software engineer, and I am a heavily computer science influenced software engineer. And I spend about half of my time these days on more research stuff, reading papers and books on job development and working through ideas for how we might help that.
S1 10:00	Yeah, yeah. So it's quite a jump, of course, leaving up and going into learning and helping people to learn and to educate. Why did it happen? What motivates you to do that?
S2 10:21	Yeah, there's a few ways I can approach that [laughter]. I went to this college, Cal Tech, that fed into a lot of national science programs. NASA and [DARBA?] and things like that, and so the discussions there were always about human scale impact. And we had the NASA administrator at the time come by and say to us, "Okay. You're the best and brightest. You're going to one of the best research universities in the world, and you are privileged, and you have all of these possibilities open to you. That's great. Good for you. Now, you have to use them for good. You have to do something that matters."
S2 11:24	When I got out in the broader software community, I was one of the only people that didn't go into research. I wanted to make things at the time when I graduated. I guess I was disappointed by the impact and the ambition of what most of commercial software [laughter] engineering and sales-- so I thought long and hard about where I could make an impact, and the first step for that was really deciding the metric of what that impact is and what matters, and I've been heavily influenced by the work of the physicist David Deutsch and, through him, have sort of derived the metric for myself that I want to expand the reach of human knowledge and ability. So I thought about how I might do that.
S2 12:18	We would expand our reach if we lived longer, so there's great opportunities there in biotech and chemical engineering. And we would expand our reach if we had better tools for experimentation. And so fabrication tools and synthesis tools are appealing, virtual reality is appealing, arificial intelligence strongly is appealing along that axis. But eventually I decided that, given my background and my opportunities, making a contribution to education would be my best bet, because if I can create a generation of life long learners, then we will have more people trying to solve these problems.
S1 13:05	So it's in a way on a meta level right? Like you were building tools for software and now you're building a way for people to learn.
S2 13:21	Yeah, that's my hope. It's a way for people to learn, but a big challenge in learning is about the meta learning. It's a way for people to learn without destroying their self confidence. It's a way for people to learn without destroying their attitude towards education. I would be satisfied with the same efficacy - the same, say, math scores in graduates of tools that I use - if their attitudes towards math were better at the end and they were more interested in continuing to learn later on in life.
S1 14:01	Right. Because I mean we have schools already. We have like - for kids, and then once you graduate you go to university.
S2 14:11	[chuckles] Yeah.
S1 14:12	Is it not good enough, or did you have any frustrations there that--
S2 14:16	Right. No. It's not good enough. And it's not good enough along many axes. So the most fundamental axis along which it's not good enough is that most people don't know how to access to you know - what you just described. And that's I think the most important thing to fix and the thing to fix first. And that's why the mission right now is a free education for everybody. And [?] mission's actually a free world-class education for everybody, so we're perhaps focusing on the free and for everybody part first, and then world-class will come, but that gets to the second point, which is that I'm not really satisfied with what counts as world-class right now.
S2 15:06	I had so many classmates who had the best education money could buy and were topping Nobel laureates. And who just had awful attitudes towards learning. And considered themselves done as soon as they graduated. And just wanted to go off and [laughter] and find some steady job, where they can kind of turn their brains off. Because they'd been so beaten down by the system and their curiosity and intellect so damaged.
S1 15:41	That sounds like a big frustration.
S2 15:47	[laughter] I think so. I think you ask the average person what they think of math and they say either, "Oh, math's boring or I'm not good at math. I'm not a math person." Similar responses for sciences. If you ask about literature, maybe they'll talk about some books whose plots they found interesting, but they used to read in school, and now that's kind of over, so I suppose the biggest change I would like to affect is to [chuckles] change our perception of education being over after college is done, which is not really a technical problem, and that's why I sort of hesitate with the label "Software Engineer". That's definitely where a lot of my expertise is, but my ambitions are bleeding elsewhere [chuckles].
S1 16:46	Yeah, so you seem to have this really big plan, right? So you have your focus on lifelong learning. Do you have a vision where you want to be  in, I don't know, maybe not forever but like ten years? Do you know where you would like to go towards, or where you would like to be, or what you would like to have achieved?
S2 17:22	Yeah. That's a great and generous question. Right. So, right now the standard means of learning are broadly prescriptive. What I mean by that is that, you read a textbook, and you passively absorb that information, or you watch a video, you watch a lecture. You are meant to sit and absorb, and perhaps there's a conversation afterwards if you are wealthy. After you graduate, you just sort of have to construct those things for yourself. I'm really interested in so called constructivist learning environments, and that's a term from Papert, who was a learning researcher a few decades ago. In a constructivist learning environment, the student creates the knowledge for herself, rather than by reading it from much of text and sort of passively absorbing it. In these models, it's a little bit more like an environment that has been constructed, such that the features the environment will encourage or require you to have understood something in order to manipulate them.
S2 18:38	The example there from Papert's research is he invented Logo, and was trying to use Logo to teach children not about programming really, but about abstraction and procedural thinking, and so he had a classroom where there was the literal physical Logo turtle. There was a mechanical turtle at the time. It would draw on physical paper [chuckles]. And so, surrounding the classroom were drawings that the turtle had made. On some of these drawings were source code, and on many of them were not. And the drawings would change over time, with the students, and the idea is that the student would maybe see a flower and the student would say, "Oh, I like that drawing. Can I have it?" And the instructor would say, "Well, you can have it. You just have to type this code into the thing and then the turtle will draw it." And the student will say, "Okay, cool," and then they'll have the drawing, but they'll look at another one, and that one doesn't have the source code.
S2 19:45	These other drawings in the environment are designed so as to require that the student understood something in order to have produced them. So the environment is scuplted in that way. The hypothesis that I'm investigating and likely will be investigating for many years, is that by allowing people to construct knowledge for themselves, we can hopefully-- I will be happy with-- achieve the same learning outcomes, first off. But with much-improved metacognitive outcomes - that is, their self esteem is higher, their attitude towards learning is higher, their interest in learning more is greater.
S1 20:37	Right. Well that sounds like a really cool goal.
S2 20:43	[laughter] Thanks. I will probably fail and that is okay.
S1 20:48	Well, yeah, but I think you'll do many things right. We'll see. So you wrote a lot about this - at least a fair bit about it like the influence like XOXO had and then leaving Apple and pursuing your dreams, is there also anything you miss, from Apple?
S2 21:20	Yeah, I miss the people. That's a big thing. This is actually something I find really frustrating about the industry right now this-- there're so many brilliant people locked up in this enormous corporations and occasionally they're being put to good use, but often they're just gears in a machine and their intellectual contributions could be enormous and so much more impactful. I don't just mean working on my projects. I mean it broadly, in general. It makes me sad both because I miss them, on a very sentimental level, I miss having that stimulating conversation with these very experienced people who are at Next or something. But I also wish that their impact could be greater.
S1 22:17	Yeah. Talk a little bit more about your time at Apple. What was it like to build a framework that's used by so many people? I mean, first you were building games and then there is the dots, I'm not sure [laughter] and all over sudden you're working on UI kits like [crosstalk]--
S2 22:47	Sorry, go on.
S1 22:50	There are difference...
S2 22:56	So one of those dots was this framework called Sparkle and that was a brief introduction, I did that when I was 16, and that taught me a little bit about the realities of framework development, namely that you change GPIs on people, and then they get angry [laughter]. Which is one of the fundamental realities of framework development, but honestly, I really didn't understand what I was doing until I got to Apple, and that was kind of the point. I finished college, and I had these broader ambitions, but Apple seemed like a great place to train, and it was. It still is. I would still recommend it to anybody for that reason. I worked on a team of people. We've been building frameworks for ten plus years, and I guess I was kind of thrown in the deep end. I was forced to really rapidly train and understand many unusual and unique concerns when designing frameworks at that scale, especially frameworks with binary compatibility concerns, which Sparkle did not have, so only source compatibility concerns. And everybody around me was incredibly generous with their time and attention and I got great mentorship and after making many, many mistakes, I absolutely understood what the hell I was doing. And then a couple years later left and may never use those skills again [laughter]. I don't know [laughter].
S1 24:29	What kind of stuff really surprised you about doing this?
S2 24:37	I think binary compatibility was my greatest surprise. I did not understand the difficulties and complexities which that induced. So, to illustrate-- this is the bug of the form. Like on IOS-8, this button has a white background, and on IOS-7 it's transparent.
S1 25:04	Yeah.
S2 25:05	And I would say it isn't released yet so it must be our fault. So what's happening here? You're digging a little bit and you realize that- much worse, this bug is of the form- a method was called when I was seven which took care of this issue but I would say that this method is not called. So they're like, "Okay, why  is it not called?" Then very rapidly this deteriorates into disassembling third-party code to which you do not have the source, in order to try to figure out what's going on. About half the time, somebody was doing something heinous and this was the strange way in which  that manifested, and half the time we  had changed something in an unexpected way, and we'd need to add some defenses for this reason.
S1 26:06	Right, yeah, that sounds like a lot of work.
S2 26:12	Yeah, it was sort of detective work.
S1 26:16	Yeah, it's like-- it sounds a little bit also like what Peter Steinberg did, but on a bigger scale.
S2 26:23	Yeah, for sure, for sure. I'm sure that [laughter] at least Peter likely has access to source when he needs it. The releases were so secret that we couldn't ask, "Hey, Facebook guys, why are you doing this?" We'd have to figure it out [laughter]. Although, I absolutely admire the work that Peter and his team are doing. I think that-- that's a great thing. And I would love to see more of that. I would love to see more development of frameworks by the community. Facebook's making great contributions there. And that's [inaudible] good [inaudible] guys.
S1 27:03	Yeah.
S3 27:05	That's super interesting that the people inside of Apple have to do the same thing, just in the other direction.
S2 27:16	Oh yeah.
S3 27:16	You guys also have to disassemble stuff because you don't have the source and [?] disassemble your [?] because you don't have the source.
S2 27:24	That's right, and as a third-party dev, I have to disassemble UIKit and I do it on a pretty regular basis, because I'm like, "UIKit, why the hell?" And the easiest way to get an answer is to just look at this and look at [laughter].
S1 27:39	Yeah. So with all the frameworks and stuff, what kind of stuff are you really excited about? I guess you're also excited with Swift and the opportunities there?
S2 27:55	Yeah, these are pragmatic excitements, I should say. Like when we talk about what stuff I'm really excited about, it is not I suppose in the consumer software sharing industry in general. But as far as helping me get my work done, what am I excited about? The category of things I'm most excited about are really interactive prototyping tools. So if you're trying to make an interaction that did not exist before - or even one that sort of vaguely has existed before - there really are no tools for it. We're still broadly designing in Photoshop. When you design in Photoshop you produce something that looks like you designed in Photoshop. I remember at Apple-- I can tell the difference between stuff that was made according to specs that came in from Photoshop and stuff that was made according to specs that came in via After Effects and stuff that was made according to specs that came in via live prototypes - it was a huge difference. So there are some tools out there that are trying to do this. I think none of them have gotten it right yet, but I am watching this with great fascination, hoping to contribute as well.
S1 29:07	You mean tools like Framer and that kind of stuff?
S2 29:11	Yeah, Framer is a pretty good example. I'm very interested in things like Form, which was just bought by Google, and Origami, of course, which is interesting. Yeah, nobody's got it right. I worked on a prototyping tool internal to Apple that got some things more right and other things less right. Each of these tools has pros and cons. We've actually been compiling a list of "you might use this tool for this purpose, you might use this tool for this purpose." We find that we have to bounce around. I feel that none of them actually excel at any of the purposes except perhaps making things that are very much like things that already exist. For which, [Pixate?] is actually promising. If you want something that has an IOS idiomatic kind of response, I'd say [Pixate?] is pretty good.
S1 30:22	I mean, storyboards are also moving there in a way, right?
S2 30:27	[Laughter].
S1 30:27	No?
S2 30:28	I guess, I'm not sure in what sense you mean that.
S1 30:32	I mean, like prototyping wise. The stuff you get...
S2 30:35	They're horrible [laughter]. I guess don't publish that. Let me rephrase. One way I like to think about this is, so there are discrete modes of interaction and there are continuous modes of interaction. Something like a mouse click is a discrete form of interaction and something like an adjuster is continuous form of interaction. Similarly there are discrete states of your application and there are continuous states of your application. So something like scrolling around a scroll view is continuous and navigating to a different level of a navigational stack is discrete. Storyboards allow you to manipulate only the discrete and discrete section of that quadrangle. You can make it so that when you tap a thing then there is a discrete transition to a completely different place. But I find that the least interesting kind of interaction, and frankly I think that our user interfaces are dominated by that kind of interaction primarily because we don't have tools which allow us to think about other kinds.
S1 31:54	Yeah. Definitely.
S2 32:00	But even starting in IOS-7, the sort of the discrete modes are blurred a great deal. You know being able to tap a table of your cell and being able to expand something beneath it - it's a very trivial example of something that storyboards would have difficulty representing.
S1 32:18	Right. Yeah, we would need more Brett Victors working on that.
S2 32:23	Yeah. Yeah. We do, and that's part of why I [laughter] wish-- yeah, I wish fewer people were making photo-sharing apps.
S3 32:36	Yeah, and outside of the space of consumer software, what excites you there?
S2 32:46	Yeah, let's see. Deep [neural?] networks and research into-- oh my gosh.
S1 33:04	It's all right.
S2 33:07	Yeah, I've been reading a lot of papers in different fields and I'm still getting my head around this. I think the ones that have stood out to me recently have been about child development first of, or about educational or pedagogical models. Obviously I'm excited about these things. One of the most exciting ones I read was-- excuse me, a survey in which a classroom of fifth graders, sorry, first graders who are five were given no formal math instruction of any kind, and instead they were given a bunch of activities which change day by day that were just placed around their environment, that were games. And after a year of this they were assessed. They were asked questions like, if you have eight bananas in the bowl and you give three of them to me then how many are remaining in the bowl. And even though the children hadn't been taught any formal arithmetic methods, they were all able to answer these questions and had great metacognitive characteristics as well. So things like that are incredibly exciting to me.
S1 34:13	Yeah.
S3 34:17	Yeah, those are interesting assumptions underlying traditional school, right? The base assumption, that is not tested, is if you wouldn't go there, would you still learn this? Or if you-- you know, it's this assumption that you learn more by being there. I mean at least in broad terms in the young age.
S2 34:38	Yeah. You know, it's tricky because it's true that the paper isn't-- that the paper's testing something slightly different which is if we carefully construct this environment so as to be full of math activities will you learn the same amount? But you could say it is testing also, if we do not do traditional math in education, will you learn the same amount? You can't quite separate the result, so additional study is needed, of course.
S1 35:10	Yes. Yes. Okay. So what's the most important thing you learned since starting at Com?
S2 35:20	[chuckles] Leading teams is hard [chuckles].
S1 35:26	Why?
S3 35:27	Why?
S2 35:32	I mean it is a distinct skill set in which I had little practice [chuckles], I think like any skill that is hard. In the software industry I think we, on a pretty regular basis, throw individual contributing engineers into leadership roles and sort of expect them to excel when, of course, it is a distinct skill set, and we have to recognize that and appreciate that. So, a lot of learning has been required there.
S1 36:01	Yes. How many people are on your team? Can you share that?
S2 36:04	Yeah, sure. It is sort of a diasporatic number. There's a bunch of mobile engineers and all sort of working on different projects. There's roughly, there's these like four other mobile engineers. And then, I had a design partner [?] took with me from Apple and she has, I guess three designers that she's bringing with.
S1 36:36	That's cool. And so the other thing that I find really interesting that you said is you had at Apple you had some really good mentors. What make them good and what did you learn from them?
S2 36:58	The primary thing that made them good was the generosity with their time. That was always a challenge at Apple and-- Apple had the problem that it culturally does not value mentorship. One is not particularly rewarded for that, and it's not really built into the culture, teaching, learning. And so often-- well, I'll not say that.
S2 37:27	Anyway, I was fortunate enough to be able to pester a few people into spending a fair amount of time teaching me things, and in certain cases I made mistakes egregious enough to [chuckles] have people spend their time teaching me things without requiring pestering. And let's see, what made it effective? Probably their experience. The industry is an interesting place right now, because it's flooded by new grads, and the new grads are noisy and they're on Twitter and they're the ones that are speaking at conferences. But this industry has been around for a while. And there sure are a whole lot of software engineers with 15, 20 years of professional experience in the field, and they're not as noisy. You don't read stuff by them all the time. They're mostly locked away in companies, where they can't talk, but they sure do know a lot [laughter].
S1 38:30	Yeah, I found-- yeah, you learn a lot by working with people who are either very experienced. But also when they're inexperienced in a certain field that can still be-- it's not mentoring I guess, but you can learn a lot, yeah.
S2 38:48	Yeah, I was struck by-- there was a talk given by a Facebook paper engineer named Jason Potter. And he came from the server engineering world to the land of UI app development. And he was a novice in UI app development world, but fairly experienced engineering in the server engineering world. And so he was able to ask all these pretty unique questions, like, "Why are we doing it this way? Why this pattern? Why don't we try this thing?" And that's a pretty cool position to be in.
S1 39:20	Yeah, you have to have at least some credibility to ask that.
S2 39:26	[chuckles] That's true. There's some gumption required there.
S1 39:29	Yeah. Let me think. Did you have any quick questions?
S3 39:43	Maybe we should talk a bit about Swift.
S2 39:46	Sure.
S3 39:46	I saw that you're a fan of Swift, but I also saw that you feel that you made maybe not the best decision in forcing it on your team that early? I'm interested in your-- because you're already using it like on a bigger scale, more people.
S2 40:08	Yep.
S3 40:09	I'm really interested in your experience there and what parts do you think make it easier, what speeds development up and what holds you back.
S2 40:17	Yeah. I think that's probably a good thing for people to hear. So we have something like 20k Locket Swift and there are four contributers to that particular project, all contributing in Swift. And the issue that I have or that I've spoken to is really an issue of practicality versus idealism. The issues that I have with the language I'm sure are temporary and are-- they're frankly-- I mean they don't really matter in the scheme of things, just in the same sense that like any app that you can build in six months probably doesn't matter. So take my complaints with a grain of salt. As far as the long term health of the ecosystem and of professional software development goes, I think it will be an excellent contribution and these rocky first months don't particularly matter. Right. So as far as how it has helped us, I think it helps us write clearer code. That's the primary thing that I enjoy when I read a Swift interface. When I read a block of Swift code, I have a much better idea of what's happening and what's not going to happen. I can see return values and the return values tell me more. I can use enums to model more accurately the states of the system, we can use value types in order to sort of constrain and confine and limit dependencies, most critically.
S2 42:10	More broadly, we can move towards this pattern that I strangely endorse, which is really treating it as a library and not as a framework. In terms of problems, the tooling is not there, and that's not a dig on the engineers. I happen to think actually that the Swift engineering team is one of Apple's finest engineering teams, but it's not done yet. You know, it's full of bugs [chuckles]. It crashes. It generates faulty code occasionally. Most critically for us, it's just really slow. Really, really, really slow. The lack of incremental compilations I think, the biggest [pain?] point . We're building a UI application, and as much as I'd like to spend all of my time thinking about how to improve learning, at some point, I've got to polish interactions and animations, and doing that with a two-minute turn around time is really damaging - not only to productivity but actually to just morale. Like it just makes everybody angry. Everybody's just angry, all the time. That's awful [chuckles].
S1 43:33	Not a good situation.
S2 43:35	No. No. And worse, I mean, it makes us lazy. I mean, we don't want to change stuff.
S1 43:43	Yeah.
S2 43:44	So I would not be surprised if the Swift-implemented UI areas of this application turn out less polished than the obviously implemented areas of the application. Just because we can't iterate on it without going insane.
S1 43:57	Ouch.
S2 43:59	Yeah. But that's temporary. You know, I'm not worried about it. They know about this. They're working on it. They'll fix it.
S1 44:05	Yeah, I have a feeling you know what to do really. I guess they mismanaged expectations a bit.
S2 44:11	There were mismanaged expectations, I think that's very true. And frankly I think there were mismanaged not out of malice, I think Apple just didn't know. They hadn't built anything this big.
S1 44:28	Yeah, definitely. It's an interesting situation right now, I wonder what's going to happen.
S2 44:38	They're going to integrate all the languages, that what's going to happen.
S3 44:44	You have this unique perspective on the frameworks and UI kit. What is your outlook on what's going to happen in this phase, in the frameworks and UI kit but many others as well because-- do you think there is anything there'll be in the short term, something happening, or will this be a very normal process?
S2 45:10	I think it'll be a long process, and this is just speculation at this point. I should make clear I don't actually have insider knowledge here. At least when I was there, the teams spent the majority of their time not on sort of being framework maintainers and like improving things as a framework, but really like supporting market features like, "Oh, even bigger screen sizes here. Oh, you've got to spread this new hardware." That's what takes most of the time. So, it will take a conscious decision to do anything non-trivial, and I don't see that forthcoming.
S2 45:51	I think that if we fast-forward ten years into the future, [laughter] the APIs are all going to change. I have no doubt either that will happen or it will be an incredible disappointment. In a year I think you'll get better annotated headers.
S1 46:10	Yeah, or we'll have somebody, I don't know, maybe somebody like Justin wrapping it all up in a nice way.
S2 46:20	Yeah, well, so that's going to happen in the short term. I have no doubt about that. Facebook's doing it right now, but it's not Swift. It's a C++ thing with their components project, which I think is valorous. That's a great idea. React is a lovely design. One of the complaints that I have about my time at Apple is that, because the culture doesn't value learning, nobody read. I mean this in the sense that scientists say when they talk about reading. Nobody reads the journals. Nobody reads the papers. Nobody knows what's going on in the broader community. People didn't know about React and [?] all this stuff. That was very frustrating.
S1 47:01	Sorry, go ahead.
S2 47:02	It's okay. Anyway, I think those things are great contributions and I have no doubt that somebody will treat you like a library. Treat these frameworks as libraries and wrap them up in something nicer.
S1 47:17	Right.
S2 47:18	I won't get great adoption until Apple does it and it'll forever be behind and feel like an impedance mismatch until Apple does it.
S1 47:29	So now that you've left for a while you can also I guess, do more community stuff. You're speaking and you're writing, do you have any other plans there, or...?
S2 47:43	More of the same, I'd like to publish more open-source stuff. I've been a little bitten by that in the past. It's tricky, you publish open-source stuff [chuckles], funny enough, people expect you to maintain it. I think we haven't quite gotten clear the contracts that we expect socially around open-source software, and there's a kind of open-source software that's, like, "Here's a library, and you should use this, and let's build a community around this, and let's maintain this and make it real," and then there's a kind of open-source software that's like, "I made this and I'm sharing it with you for educational purposes or for interest, and I'm not interested in [?] or issues or maintaining this or whatever." I probably mostly just have time for the latter, because, frankly, software engineering is not the interesting part of the problems I'm trying to solve right now. I would like to do more of that.
S1 48:43	Yeah. So we're not going to get a new Sparkle.
S2 48:50	The GitHub guys wrote one, between all the other libraries that they write.
S1 49:05	Yeah, they should do something with open source, maybe. You're good at it.
S3 49:10	[Awesome?] procrastination strategy.
S1 49:12	Yeah.
S1 49:14	I think-- I don't have any other concrete questions. Do you have anything else?
S3 49:21	I have one question on my mind and that's more in the educational space. I think one other big difference between what you're working on or what Com is doing in general and the more traditional lines of education is that if you're a kid and you want to learn something, you can't just go to [Con?] Academy and look at it and you are forced into a certain curriculum or you are forced into learning certain things in a certain sequence at a certain time. What do you think is the impact of this in this whole learning process?
S2 50:02	Yeah. Another child development researcher, Piaget, has a lot to say about this. He says that one of the very important things that must happen in our development of young minds is the training of autonomy. And autonomy is meant here in a broader sense than we normally mean it when we talk about autonomy. It's not just autonomy like, "Oh, I'm free to play on the playground," but autonomy like, "I am making my own choices - broadly, in general - for all of the things that are going on in my life." And this is contravened by somebody telling you how to spend your day, by an appeal to authority, "Bobby cheated when we played this game." An autonomous answer would be for the teacher to say, "Oh, well let me go talk to Bobby." Sorry, a heteronomous answer - the opposite of autonomy - would be for the teacher to say, "Oh, let me go talk to Bobby." The autonomous answer would be to say-- for the teacher to say, "And what did you say to Bobby?" The training of autonomy I think is important for many reasons. There is some  research that suggests that it provides greater outputs in the short-term.
S2 51:27	But my belief is that it will lead to greater thinkers long-term. I encourage the kind of exploration that you're describing. I think there's room for sculpting environment and so-- oh thanks. Here. Water. I have-- I'm sceptical of an entire  day being scheduled by not the student. I am positive about the idea, though, of an educator modifying the environment of the student, day to day. In a way that is sort of sculpted for their progress. For instance, to be a little more specific, I think we can do better than giving the student, "Here is the entire catalogue of human knowledge," with every element of that catalogue being sort of emphasized to the same degree. I think we might say, "Here's the entire catalogue of human knowledge" - we can picture this as a bookshelf - so a toddler comes up to the bookshelf, and there's all of human knowledge on the bookshelf. But maybe on the bottom shelf, that is most near to them, we put some things that we think might be best.
S3 52:50	Yeah, makes sense.
S1 52:55	I think we talked about this - this is not like going to be an interview - but I think I talked to you about this when we were having drinks - about the stuff that Florian and I worked on [?] whether that I contracted for or and that Florian's former company, about training the kids and getting them way more autonomous and it worked out really well.
S2 53:21	I believe it [laughter].
S3 53:23	And it's a long process. It's still ongoing after years of trying to make this change, it takes so much effort for them over there to change this culture because it's so ingrained and the specific culture, the sports environment.
S1 53:42	I think the best story was when Reuben, one of Florian's former partners told how-- or it was [?], I don't know who it was - one of them talked about a kid that would lie in bed until two then go to soccer practice, practice all afternoon, and then go back and watch movies or something at home. And now they made him in charge of his own destiny and told him, "Yeah, you could work on this and on this." And he's now showing up early and he knows what to do. And starts practising and it's [crosstalk].
S2 54:16	That's awesome.
S1 54:17	It's a massive change.
S2 54:19	That's great.
S1 54:19	Yeah, so there's something there.
S2 54:22	[laughter] Awesome.
S1 54:28	Yeah, yeah. Cool. I think we're through. I think, yeah.
S2 54:31	Guys, this was fun.
S1 54:32	Yes, really fun listening.
S3 54:37	Yeah, it's super interesting what you're doing now.
S1 54:39	Yeah.
S2 54:40	Thanks. Do you two have plans to come back to San Francisco any time soon? I know you've been travelling recently.
S1 54:47	Yeah, I hope so, some time soon.
S3 54:49	No, [inaudible] free time yet, but [crosstalk]
S2 54:51	Cool.
S1 54:53	We'll need to come over more often. That's just something we need to do [laughter]. Yeah.
S2 55:00	Sure.
S1 55:00	Yeah, yeah. It all-- it yeah, it'll take a while.
S1 55:06	But somewhere in the spring.
S2 55:08	Right on. That sounds great.
S1 55:12	Will you be in Europe any time soon?
S2 55:15	Hmm. I will be in Europe for my honeymoon in May. I've been invited to speak at NS conference in London in March. I haven't decided yet whether I'm going to do that. Conferences, they take a lot of time.
S1 55:36	Yeah, you have to know why you want to do it. Just talking [?].
S2 55:47	Yeah. I'm trying to decide if I have anything else I want to say right now. Yeah, I understand wanting to cut down. You can go into a locker [laughter].
S1 55:59	It's been enough. Cool.
S3 56:03	So we will have-- I think it will be a really nice mix, also, because we will have an interview with Natasha, who is very fresh in all this, so it's a very [interesting?] perspective, and then I did via e-mail an interview with Loren Richter.
S2 56:19	Oh, great.
S3 56:21	So he is talking about very different things--
S2 56:24	Of course, yeah.
S3 56:26	And has very interesting perspectives on things. So I think it will be a nice mixture.
S2 56:31	Excellent.
S1 56:33	Cool.
S2 56:34	Thanks, guys.
S1 56:35	We'll transcribe it and send you the workouts version, and then we'll see if there's anything you want to cut or something.
S2 56:44	That sounds great. You guys are doing a great thing for the community. Thank you.
S1 56:47	Cool. You, too. Enjoy your day.
S2 56:51	Enjoy your evening. Bye-bye.
S1 56:52	Thanks. Bye-bye.
