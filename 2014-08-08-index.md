This month's issue is about a topic we've wanted to cover for a long time: Testing.

Automated testing isn't a very long-standing tradition in Apple's developer community. Some people love it, some hate it, and others just haven't gotten around to really looking into it. Regardless, testing has many different aspects, and we hope that no matter what camp you're in, you'll be able to take something away from this issue.
