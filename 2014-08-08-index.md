This month's issue is about a topic we wanted to do for a long time: Testing.

Automated testing doesn't have a very longstanding tradition in Apple's developer community. Some people love it, some hate it, and others just haven gotten around to really look into it. Testing has many different aspects, and we hope that no matter what camp you're in, you'll be able to take something away form this issue.
