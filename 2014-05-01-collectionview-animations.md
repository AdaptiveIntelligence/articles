- Intro to collection views and related classes and how they're used
- Basics of collection layouts and flow layouts 
- Animating layout changes
  - Inserting/Removing objects
  - Item size changes
  - Device rotation changes
- Basic layout to layout navigation transitions and examples
  - `useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions`
- Custom layout to layout transitions for complex viewcontroller hierarchies
  - How do we animate from table/collection view with collection views as rows (as in http://ashfurrow.com/blog/putting-a-uicollectionview-in-a-uitableviewcell) to a grid detail view similar to what `useLayoutToLayoutNavigationTransitions` does.
  

Looking forward to comments. What do you think?
