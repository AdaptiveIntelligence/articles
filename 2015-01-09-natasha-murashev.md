C: Thanks for taking the time, Natasha! Could you tell us a little bit of what you currently do in your job and in the developer community?

N: By day I’m an iOS engineer at Capital One, and we’re working on a bunch of native apps. And then usually I wake up early and usually do blogging or learning or building something, so morning is kind of like my time to grow.

C: The apps you build at Capital One, are these internal or also external apps?

N: They’re external, but they’re not out yet. Capital One is just started to build native apps around a year ago. The stuff we're working on will be out next year.

C: Exciting --- how big is the team there now?

N: It’s pretty big. We have offices in DC, Richmond, and Wilmington, Delaware. And I think there’s probably like 15 iOS developers. Whenever I go back to DC it’s the best, because I get to learn a lot from some of the best developers in the industry. And we're building out a team in San Francisco, it's about three or four developers right now.

C: Is it a challenge to work in a young team like that?

N: The team gets along very well. But yeah, there’s definitely challenges just from having a bigger team, for example in terms of workflow, but so far, it's working really well. We just use a basic agile process, and then do a lot of pull requests to look over people’s code.

C: So why did you get into iOS development? You weren’t always an iOS developer...?

N: Yeah, no. So I always wanted to learn, or since I started developing, and

At my last company, I was doing Ruby on Rails and they had a hard time hiring iOS developers, so they mentioned if anybody wanted to learn iOS and switch. So I started thinking about that and I applied to the Mobile Makers bootcamp. After I got in I went to my boss, and he let me go for a two-month sabbatical, during which went to Chicago for an eight-week full-time course. I really liked this experience because you have instructors that are teaching you best practices, as opposed to just fiddling around for yourself. When I came back I joined the iOS team.

C: Could you tell us a bit more about the bootcamp --- what did you learn there?

N: We learned a lot of Objective-C, which was the biggest challenge to me initially, as it seemed pretty intimidating. Every morning we learned new stuff and immediately applied it in the afternoon, when we were building stuff together with others. We built an app every week, and at the end of the bootcamp we had to release an app on the App Store.

C: How did you get into programming at all, and why?

It started when I cam to visit San Francisco for a weekend. I absolutely fell in love with the tech scene. I went to a lot of meetups, and learned about startups, and, it was just a really positive and creative atmosphere. So I moved here and within a year I was working on a startup with some friends. But I wasn’t able to code myself at the time, but since I’m a hands-on person, I don’t like having my hands tied. That was really frustrating and I basically just started to learn on my own that way.

C: So you picked up enough Rails on your own to land a job as a Rails developer?

N: Yeah. Intially I started with the Stanford course. I just did that online, and then I started learning Rails. I could kind of hack things together and make it work, I knew that’s not how I wanted to program. So around that time, Dev Bootcamp just came out. I applied there and ended up in the second class of Dev Bootcamp. That was an an opportunity for me to learn smarter approaches to programming.

C: What did you study in college, by the way?

N: Psychology, it’s actually been the most useful major.

There’s that stereotype of programmers, sitting alone in the basement somewhere. But in real life you have to work with people. It's  a lot about group dynamics and group think. Trying to put in different opinions is very important sometimes, because often times when you all know each other, everyone just agrees on things, and that might not be the right thing. There are also a lot of things around leadership, like caring for other people and developing a relationship that’s outside of just your everyday coding.


C: What do you think about all the new stuff that has come out recently, like Swift and WatchKit, and then iOS 8. What are you excited about?

N: Everything? So I love learning. That’s actually one of my favorite things about being a programmer. I missed that in my other jobs, but in programming there are just much more ups and downs with opportunities to learn. For example, Swift looks really easy on the outside. When it was announced, all the JavaScript developers were like „Oh, I’m now an iOS developer.“ But from working with it, I’ve actually found that it’s actually harder than Objective-C. Objective-C is very simple, you can only do so many things. But in Swift there’s a whole new other world of for example functional patterns, but there are no best practices yetyet --- it’s kind of a Wild West‚ there’s so many choices.

With reagard to WatchKit, it’s pretty simple at the moment, but I think the promise of it is really exciting. I acutally just got one of those FitBit scales, and the way it just communicates seemlessly is really magical. So I’m excited about that aspect of the Watch, of being able to track information and sync it seemlessly.

C: If I recall correctly, you were disappointed about it initially, but then got really excited about it, right?

N: Yeah, it’s missing a lot of features that were advertised. So for example, there’s no API for the digital crownor the tactic feedback. So it’s just very simple. For showing a map it takes a picture of the map and sends it to the  watch. But we had a WatchKit hackathon and it was pretty cool to see what people were able to do with just the basic stuff that's there already.

C: When Swift came out, you suddenly became much more visible in the community. Was this a deliberate choihce you made?

N: I’ve actually been blogging for awhile. When I started coding I started my blog, it’s my way of soldifying my knowledge. At this point, if I learn something, I have to blog about it. It’s just part of my routine. So when Swift came out it was just a natural extension of that. And of course with Swift, since it’s so new, there’s a lot more to write about, since there’s a lot more struggles on a daily basis that you can’t find the answers to.

C: Did the visiblity you got in the Swift community change something for you?

N: I just keep doing what I've keep doing. I did start a Swift newsletter, but that's also part of my way of learning. The new part is that i've started doing a lot of speaking engagements and that’s been really fun and works very well for solidifying my knowledge. When you’re teaching, you have to really learn your stuff. With the WatchKit hackathon we gambled a bit, because the release date was not clear yet. And in the end I had to like learn WatchKit in three days and then teach it. But I enjoyed the pressure because it forces me to learn it, whereas on my own I’d probably take a longer time and then I wouldn’t learn it as well as when I have to actually be an expert on it after three days.

C: Do you think there is a way to like keep this feeling? Because now everybody’s learning Swift, but maybe in a few years there will be established things. Like do you think there’s a way we can keep the community as open and as learning?

N: Well I think, I was reading the other day that like Swift doesn’t have different styles, not because it’s new but because it’s like so big and complicated. Not big, but there’s a lot more opportunites, or a lot more variations that you can have in Swift, and I’m starting to get that feeling as well, that there might not be kind of one way, one go-to way to do things, like there is a lot of times in Objective-C. So I think, yeah, I think we can definitely develop, and I think Swift allows—and I don’t know how it will develop, obviously it’s only in 1.0, but—I think there could be more opportunities to do things differently across Swift, so hopefully that’ll open people up for different possibilities, and you know, kind of learning different things.

C: So we’re almost at the end of the year. Do you have any ambitions or any concrete plans for next year?

N: Yeah, I do have a list. A lot of it is just keeping healthy. Swift has been so exciting that I’ve just always been learning and pushing myself. But hoping to get back to a normal sleep schedule. I’ve found that when you sleep enough, you actually get a lot more done, although it might feel counterintuitive at times. I think my main thing is just to double down on learning. Swift has opened up a whole other world of things I wanna learn. I am missing definitely some pieces in my programming experience. So, I think I’ll be just focused on learning those pieces, and then figuring out how to best fit them in to write better code.

C: Do you have big ambitions for the long term, like on a five year scale?

N: I don’t like to think too long term because things chance. It’s kind of like code. You have to rewrite everything. For me it’s more like having a state every day versus having a big goal. Every day when I wake up I wanna ask myself “Am I happy?” And I know things that make me happy, like learning, being healthy, and traveling. Those are the big three things that I try to center myself around. I feel that there's still a lot to gain for me by learning more, and then maybe in a year or so, I'll focus more on really building and releasing things.

C: Could you also see yourself doing something completely different than programming?

N: Probably not. I don’t know, maybe in ten years, who knows? But, no, I really enjoy it. I don’t know if I can find a field where I have infinite things to learn. I’ve been interested also in learning more hardware stuff but I think that’s going together with software. As long as I keep learning new things and keep challenging my mind, and like being a little bit outside my comfort zone, which is my favorite place to be and makes me happy, I’m happy to continue what I'm doing.

===

C: Did you ever like, did you have any like mentors or people who really inspired you w2hen learning and when, I don’t know, learning iOS and Rails and stuff?

N: Yeah, so actually another basically best psychology thing for learning is pair programming, so, I made sure that out of the bootcamp—and at that bootcamp you do pair programming all the time—and that’s really, that really accelerates things for learning, so I try to be put into environments where I get a lot more pair programming and in, yeah Manila, you I started with Ruby on Rails and that’s helped a lot just seeing senior developers program, ‘cause I found that I would, you know, I have a problem or a bug and I find one solution that works and I’m really happy, I’m like “Yay, it works.” But then, you know, a senior programmer, you know people that I would see, they’re like, you know, kind of write it down, “OK, this works, let’s see if this other thing works.” And they kind of explore different solutions to see which one is not only works but is the best for the solution. So those type of things. So basically my coworkers, I try to work with people who are better than me, so that’s who inspires me, ‘cause then I can get the mentorship and at Capital One there’s a lot of people who are better than me and I get to ??? (39:20) with them and learn from them and pair program with them once in awhile, so that’s good. And then when I switch to my iOS team, the senior iOS developer there has taught me a ton, so he would, you know, go over architecture and it wasn’t really pair programming, but he would help me, you know, review code, and he was just like, as obsessive as me with like best practices, so I got to learn a lot from him, yeah. And now I think for Swift, ‘cause it’s new and just learning from the community, from you, from, you know, your book, trying to read more books to get that sense, yeah, so always looking for people who are better than me.

C: So, so like I imagine when you do like a lot of pair programming, there’s a lot of like important small things that you learn. Where there any like really big things which were like eye opening, or was it mostly lots of small things?

N: Yeah, I think that’s just me. I’m very detail-oriented, so I do enjoy kind of the tiny little things, you know, and just tiny tricks that I learn. And I usually blog if there’s something, like for example, I think you could turn on the Klang analyzer in Xcode and I wouldn’t have ever—which gives you better like warning messages, but, you know, if someone hasn’t told me that, like I wouldn’t have even like Googled that to know. I wouldn’t have even known to Google that. Right, so, when you pair program you learn these tiny things that like people take for granted, and actually that’s some of my most popular blog posts, of just things that I’m like “Oh everyone probably knows that except me,” and then I blog about it and people will Tweet it like crazy, ‘cause they’re like “Oh, that’s a cool thing.”

C: Yeah definitely.

N: Yeah, I guess some bigger things, maybe like more architecture, so one of my coworkers at Capital One, when I was structuring like a form, he went through the MVVM pattern, so Model View ViewModel, and I’ve heard about it, I heard Facebook talk about it, but I wasn’t really sure how it worked, so it was really cool have him kind of like walk me through an actual implementation of it, and talk through the different, how he did, and then when I did it on my own in a different app, I was able to tweak it a bit and kind of figure out my comfort zone and ??? (42:07), so those are, yeah those are probably the bigger things, but most of the time with pair programming it’s like the very little things that you learn.

C: Yeah. Yeah, no I can totally like. It was very similar for us, Like Florian and me did lots of pair programming together, and we both learned so much with, yeah, more people should do that, absolutely.

N: Yeah, definitely.

F: You are really, you are a passionate learner, and I was wondering, is there something, like, is this the learning in itself that drives it for you, or is there something, because you are learning all these skills, is there something you want, some big idea you have you want to put them to use? Or is it more the learning in itself that drives the motivation for you?

N: Yeah so, I enjoy building, but I think I have kind of like commitment issues, of like you know if I have, like I guess part of me wants to do a startup or build my own, you know, kind of business, but whenever I have an idea and I work on it for three months, after three months I’m kind of like, “OK, I’ve kind of like figured it out” so I think that is the part that’s learning, and then I’m like “Oh, the last twenty percent, I kind of know how to do that,” so and I can learn like you know, like beacons now, so I’ll go build that. Yeah, so that’s just from experience, it’s yeah, kind of wanna be the like build a product and stick with it, but then after doing it I have a hard time, like I have a lot of ideas, and I have like an email folder for ideas, but then when it actually comes to commiting to an idea, ‘cause an idea is not just, you know, you kind of build it and you’re done. It’s sort of, like you’re stuck with it, and that worries me about the learning because, you know, you have a product, and like if it’s successful, then you can make like little tweaks but not big ones, or yeah, so I think that’s just more of a commitment thing. So I do have ambition to do that, but then I haven’t found an idea that I’m like, “I can stick with this for five years.” Hopefully I’ll get there, and as I learn more, things will come more into place. I think I found that my blogging has been my biggest product, and that’s nice because I’m just writing about what I’m learning. And you know, the newsletter’s doing well, and those things, so maybe that’s something I need to figure out as doing something that’s more, you know, small chunks of learning versus kind of one product that I’m committed to. Right?

F: Very cool. Yeah, and the other question was, also because you have this like psychology background, I always feel that one thing that is very specific to the job of a programmer is this, are these ups and downs you have, and these extreme, these frustrations, you know, you have this problem and you are sitting in front of it, and basically you are, it’s impossible what’s happening there, and you don’t understand and you have these downs, and… I was wondering if you have, how do you deal with this? Do you have any strategies to deal with these kind of things, or how do you approach this part of the job?

N: So that’s actually been the hardest thing about learning programming when I started, because I wasn’t used to that, and I’ve always been a good student in school. So in school, it was a very, you know clear, I don’t know, I was, I did a lot of math in school, but it was a very clear formula. You study hard and you get an A on the test, right? Or even in my jobs before programming, it was like oh, you just kind of, you know, you had a learning thing, but it’s like, you know, if you do spreadsheets enough, you get pretty good at spreadsheets, like you don’t get bad, like, you know, it kind of moves up. You go from zero to one hundred, right? But then when I started programming, it was like that where one day I’m like on top of the world, like, you know, “I told the computer what to do, I’m a wizard, I think something, you know, the computer does what you tell it,” and then the next day, it’s just like “Oh, nothing works, computer won. You know, I can’t even program.” So yeah, definitely. So I think the biggest thing is just learning to debug has been the biggest skill, and even yesterday I was just like frustrated at animated, animating my text, ‘cause it wasn’t working the way I wanted it to, so just I think meditation helps, so just kind of breathing in, maybe walking away, somethings when you sleep you like solve a problem, so that’s always good, so that’s again back to health. And then debugging and sitting back, and just being like, “You know, let’s do one step at a time. What is this value? Is this value the thing I want it to be?” And then like questioning your assumptions and being OK with that, and just, you know, keeping humble I think. ‘Cause I think as soon as you’re like “Oh, I’m the best programmer,” like, next day, someone knows more, or you’re like “I don’t know anything.” So that’s the feeling I’m addicted to now and that’s why I love what I do. But it’s definitely, I think, the hardest thing about our jobs, because it’s not as straightforward and you can’t tell a project manager, “Oh, I spent like the whole day fixing a bug, tha like and I still don’t know what it is.” And that’s always demotivating, and you’re like, “No, I actually do know how to do my job.” So I mean, I personally love that aspect, and you know trying to just take it one step at a time, and that helps, but yeah, that’s definitely a challenge that I love.

C: It’s good that you love it because I don’t think like, I don’t know, I don’t know any other programmer who doesn’t have that.

N: Yeah, exactly. You have to love it or…

C: Or learn to.

N: Yeah, exactly.

C: Is there anything else that you want to share?

N: Yeah, it’s a fun time to be an iOS developer. So for anyone that is thinking of switching, it’s challenging, but I think, I don’t know, just seeing the way that scale worked magically yesterday, I’m just so excited about hardware and software working seemlessly and creating that magical experience. That’s something, I’m really obsessed with user experience as well, yeah it’s not just programming but it’s kind of thinking of the holistic picture. So whoever’s starting out that’s a very exciting time to be there.
