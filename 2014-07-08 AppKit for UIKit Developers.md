we'll focus on 10.10, but mention the points that were different under 10.9.
start with what's great about developing for the mac.

overview about all the knowledge you can reuse:
dev environment
language
core frameworks
libdispatch
foundation
some patterns from uikit
frameworks become more similar each year. this year many new things were made available on ios and the mac at the same time.

then let's dive into what's different:
windows, panels, nswindowcontroller
document based apps
responder chain (much more similar in yosemite, but different api)
views (layer backing, cells, coordinate system)
nsimage
drag&drop
menus
sandboxing

and what you'll miss:
uicollectionview
