Welcome to issue 22 of objc.io. This month, developers from some well-known companies in our community share with us how they work.

Brent Simmons starts off with a tour of how app development is done [at The Omni Group](/issue-22/xxx.html). Next, the team at Artsy writes about the positive impact [working in the open](/issue-22/xxx.html) has had on their culture. Kyle Van Essen describes how Square has [scaled their engineering process](/issue-22/xxx.html) to a quickly growing team and increased quality requirements. Ashley Nelson-Hornstein walks us through the [code review process](Ashley Nelson-Hornstein) at Dropbox. Finally, Adam Ernst [introduces us to Components](/issue-22/xxx.html), a React-inspired library the news feed team at Facebook developed to make their UI code easier to write and more maintainable.

Weâ€™d like to thank all our contributors. And like last month, [Ole Begemann](http://oleb.net) helped coordinate with the authors. Thanks Ole!

Best from Berlin,

Chris, Daniel, Florian, and Ole.
