## Overview

* Benefits of TDD (quick summary)

* How does BDD differ from TDD? 

* BDD Frameworks

	- RSpec syntax: `it`,`describe`,`context`
	- Compare Specta, Kiwi, Cedar 

* What is a behavior?
	- Contract with other objects in the app. 
	- Behavior defined by contract and expected by other users. (programmers/objects)

* Testing contracts
	- Why is it better to test contracts rather than implementation?
	- Example with network layer & parsing
	- Example with message formatter

* Testing view controllers & views
	- Why testing view controllers is also important?
	- How can we test behavior of view controllers?
	- Example: login button
	- Example: Send button item

* Tightining your cycles
	- Running specs from command line
	- Build automation
	- Prettifying output

* The action block
	- Problem: RSpec has issues with separating arrange and act parts of test. Assert clearly separated.
	- Solution: the action block!
	- Example usage (simplified version with action from one of previous examples)
