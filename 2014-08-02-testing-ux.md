Goal is to teach underlying principles using real life code examples not to give a comprehensive list of how to test every possible interaction.

- Intro 
* What to test? UI Logic vs Aesthetics
* Limit the amount of Magic
* Why I dislike KIF / Calabash (magic)

- Stay as close to the user as possible
* Code examples of testing specific types of user interaction (tap button, table view tap, etc)
* Use the runtime, Luke (more code examples, using the runtime which is not for everyone).

- View controllers (iOS specific)
* Challenges of testing view controllers
* Testing push / pop / modal segues

- The End
