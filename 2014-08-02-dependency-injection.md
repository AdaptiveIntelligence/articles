One of the greatest barriers to writing unit tests in Objective-C (or any language) is not knowing how to manage dependencies on things outside of the code you want to test.

## Forms of Dependency Injection

### Constructor Injection

### Property Injection

### Method Injection

### Ambient Context

### Subclass and Override Method

## So which should form should I use?

## FAQ

 - What about swizzling?
 - Which DI framework should I use?
 - I don't want to expose all these hooks.
