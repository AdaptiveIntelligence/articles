I got my first real iOS job at 500px in 2011. I had been doing iOS contracting for a few years in college, but this was my first, real iOS gig. I was hired as the sole iOS developer to make the beautifully designed iPad app. In only seven weeks, we shipped a 1.0 and continued to iterate, adding more features and, intrinsically, more complexity to the codebase.

It felt at times like I didn't know what I was doing. I knew my design patterns – like any good coder – but I was way too close to the product I was making to objectively measure the efficacy of my architectural decisions. It took bringing another developer on board the team for me to realize that we were in trouble. 

Ever heard of MVC? Massive View Controller, some call it. That's certainly how it felt at the time. I won't go into the embarrassing details, but it suffices to say that if I had to do it all over again, I would make different decisions. 

One of the key architectural changes I would make, and have made in apps I've developed since then, would be to use an alternative to Model-View-Controller called Model-View-ViewModel.
