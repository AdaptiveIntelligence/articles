This month's objc.io is all about Swift, Apple's new programming language that just has gone 1.0 the day before this issue came about.

This issue is neither an introduction to Swift, nor a guide of best practices, since the language is way too young for that. Instead we focus on some Aspects of Swift that are new and potentially very foreign to Objective-C developers, like first class functions, structs and value types, functional APIs, and making the most of playgrounds.
 
If you'd like to dive deeper into the functional aspects of Swift, please check out the Functional Programming in Swift book we're currently finishing up. It's available as early-access version now, and will be published on October 1st.
