This month's objc.io is all about Swift, Apple's new programming language that went 1.0 the day before this issue came out.

This issue is neither an introduction to Swift, nor a guide of best practices. Instead, we focus on some aspects of Swift that are new and potentially very foreign to Objective-C developers, like first-class functions, structs and value types, functional APIs, and making the most of playgrounds.
 
If you'd like to dive deeper into the functional aspects of Swift, please check out the Functional Programming in Swift book that we're currently finishing up. It's available as an early-access version now, and will be published on October 1.
