## Intro
* When would you want to use some sort of mock object?
* What's the difference between mocks, stubs, doubles and spies?
* When would you want to use each one?
* "Mockist" vs "Stateist" testing, and why you might not want to use mocks

## Using them in Objective-C
* Compare OCMockito vs OCMock (also maybe Cedar doubles/spies?)

## Common mistakes with mocking
* Don't mock what you don't own
* You probably need to use DI (link to Jon's article)
* Other techniques to minimize how much you're coupling your tests to your implementation via your mock objects
