#An Introduction to OpenCV on iOS: Let's Build a Face Recognition App

##A Bit of Background

OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning library. It contains thousands of optimized algorithms which provide a common toolkit for various computer vision applications. According to the project's [About page](http://opencv.org/about.html), OpenCV is being used in many applications ranging from stitching Street View images to running interactive art shows. ancient in our industry's time standards. 

OpenCV started out as a research project inside Intel in 1999. It has been in active development since then and evolved to support modern technologies like OpenCL and OpenGL and platforms like iOS and Android.

In 1999, [Half-Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) was just released and extremely popular. [Intel Pentium 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III) was the state of the art CPU and 400-500MHz clock speeds were considered fast. 

A typical CPU in 2006 when OpenCV 1.0 was released had about the same [CPU-performance](http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/compare/212009/1030202) as an iPhone 5.


##Overview of OpenCV

###Modules and Concepts

OpenCV is a C++ API consisting of various modules containing a wide range of functions from low level image color space conversions to high-level machine learning tools. Below is a list of most important modules as described in the [official documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/intro.html):

- **core**: a compact module defining basic data structures, including the dense multi-dimensional array Mat and basic functions used by all other modules.
- **imgproc**: an image processing module that includes linear and non-linear image filtering, geometrical image transformations (resize, affine and perspective warping, generic table-based remapping), color space conversion, histograms, and so on.
- **video**: a video analysis module that includes motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking algorithms.
- **calib3d**: basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence algorithms, and elements of 3D reconstruction.
- **features2d**: salient feature detectors, descriptors, and descriptor matchers.
- **objdetect**: detection of objects and instances of the predefined classes (for example, faces, eyes, mugs, people, cars, and so on).
- **ml*: various machine learning algorithms such as K-Means, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.
- **highgui**: an easy-to-use interface to video capturing, image and video codecs, as well as simple UI capabilities. (only a subset available on iOS)
- **gpu**: GPU-accelerated algorithms from different OpenCV modules. (unavailable on iOS)
- **ocl**: Common algorithms implemented using OpenCL. (unavailable on iOS)
- a few more helper modules such as Python bindings and user contributed algorithms.

###Fundamental Classes and Operations 

OpenCV contains hundreds of classes. Let's limit ourselves to a few fundamental classes and operations in the interest of brewity and refer to the [full documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/core.html) as further reading. Going over these core classes should be enough to get a feel for the logic behind the library.

####`cv::Mat`

`cv::Mat` is the core data structure representing any n-dimensional matrix in OpenCV. Since images are just a special case of 2-D matrices, they are also represented by a `cv::Mat`, i.e. `cv::Mat` is the class you'll be working with the most in OpenCV.

An instance of `cv::Mat` acts as a header for the image data and contains information to specify the image format. The image data itself is only referenced and can be shared by multiple `cv::Mat` instances. OpenCV uses a reference counting method similar to ARC to make sure that the image data is deallocated when the last referencing `cv::Mat` is gone.Image data itself is an array of concatenated rows of the image. (for N-dimensional matrices, the data consist of concatenated data arrays of the contained N-1 dimensional matrices). Using the values contained in the `step[]` array each pixel of the image can be adressed using pointer arithmetic: 

````
uchar *pixelPtr = cvMat.data + rowIndex * cvMat.step[0] + colIndex * cvMat.step[1]
````

The data format for each pixel is retrieved by the `type()` function. In addition to common grayscale (1 channel, `CV_8UC1`) and color (3 channel, `CV_8UC3`) images with 8-bit unsigned integers per channel, OpenCV supports many less frequent formats such as `CV_16SC3` (16-bit signed integer with 3 channels per pixel) or even `CV_64FC4` (64-bit floating point with 4 channels per pixel). While only the 8-bit per channel images can be shown on screenâ€¦
