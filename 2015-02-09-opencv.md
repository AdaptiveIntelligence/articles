#An Introduction to OpenCV on iOS: Let's Build a Face Recognition App

##A Bit of Background

OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning library. It contains thousands of optimized algorithms which provide a common toolkit for various computer vision applications. According to the project's [About page](http://opencv.org/about.html), OpenCV is being used in many applications ranging from stitching Street View images to running interactive art shows. ancient in our industry's time standards. 

OpenCV started out as a research project inside Intel in 1999. It has been in active development since then and evolved to support modern technologies like OpenCL and OpenGL and platforms like iOS and Android.

In 1999, [Half-Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) was just released and extremely popular. [Intel Pentium 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III) was the state of the art CPU and 400-500MHz clock speeds were considered fast. 

A typical CPU in 2006 when OpenCV 1.0 was released had about the same [CPU-performance](http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/compare/212009/1030202) as an iPhone 5.
