#An Introduction to OpenCV on iOS: Let's Build a Face Recognition App

##A Bit of Background

OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning library. It contains thousands of optimized algorithms which provide a common toolkit for various computer vision applications. According to the project's [About page](http://opencv.org/about.html), OpenCV is being used in many applications ranging from stitching Street View images to running interactive art shows. ancient in our industry's time standards. 

OpenCV started out as a research project inside Intel in 1999. It has been in active development since then and evolved to support modern technologies like OpenCL and OpenGL and platforms like iOS and Android.

In 1999, [Half-Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)) was just released and extremely popular. [Intel Pentium 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III) was the state of the art CPU and 400-500MHz clock speeds were considered fast. 

A typical CPU in 2006 when OpenCV 1.0 was released had about the same [CPU-performance](http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/compare/212009/1030202) as an iPhone 5.


##Overview of OpenCV

OpenCV is a C++ API consisting of various modules containing a wide range of functions from low level image color space conversions to high-level machine learning tools. Below is a list of most important modules as described in the [official documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/intro.html):

- **core**: a compact module defining basic data structures, including the dense multi-dimensional array Mat and basic functions used by all other modules.
- **imgproc**: an image processing module that includes linear and non-linear image filtering, geometrical image transformations (resize, affine and perspective warping, generic table-based remapping), color space conversion, histograms, and so on.
- **video**: a video analysis module that includes motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking algorithms.
- **calib3d**: basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence algorithms, and elements of 3D reconstruction.
- **features2d**: salient feature detectors, descriptors, and descriptor matchers.
- **objdetect**: detection of objects and instances of the predefined classes (for example, faces, eyes, mugs, people, cars, and so on).
- **ml*: various machine learning algorithms such as K-Means, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks.
- **highgui**: an easy-to-use interface to video capturing, image and video codecs, as well as simple UI capabilities. (only a subset available on iOS)
- **gpu**: GPU-accelerated algorithms from different OpenCV modules. (unavailable on iOS)
- **ocl**: Common algorithms implemented using OpenCL. (unavailable on iOS)
- a few more helper modules such as Python bindings and user contributed algorithms.
